;; Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is represented
;; as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor make-segment and selectors
;; start-segment and end-segment that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore,
;; a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify
;; a constructor make-point and selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using
;; your selectors and constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument
;; and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).
;; To try your procedures, you'll need a way to print points:
(defn make-point [x y]
  (list x y))

(defn x-point [p]
  (first p))

(defn y-point [p]

;; Exercise 2.7: Alyssa's program is incomplete because she has not specified the implementation of the interval

;; Exercise 2.9: The width of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower bounds. The width is
;; a measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the interval. For some arithmetic operations, the width of
;; the result of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, whereas for others
;; the width of the combination is not a function of the widths of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the
;; sum (or difference) of two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added (or subtracted).
;; Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.
(defn width [i]

;; width of the sum of two intervals is the sum of the widths of the intervals
;; width of the difference of two intervals is the difference of the widths of the intervals


;; Exercise 2.10: Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems programmer, looks over Alyssa's shoulder and comments that it is
;; not clear what it means to divide by an interval that spans zero. Modify Alyssa's code to check for this condition
;; and to signal an error if it occurs.

;; Exercise 2.12: After debugging her program, Alyssa shows it to a potential user, who complains that her program
;; solves the wrong problem. He wants a program that can deal with numbers represented as a center value and an
;; additive tolerance; for example, he wants to work with intervals such as 3.5 Â± 0.15 rather than 3.35 to 3.65.
;; Alyssa returns to her desk and fixes this problem by supplying an alternate constructor and alternate selectors:
(defn make-center-width [c w]

(defn center [i]
  (/ (+ (lower-bound i) (upper-bound i)) 2))
(defn width2 [i]

;; Unfortunately, most of Alyssa's users are engineers. Real engineering situations usually involve measurements
;; with only a small uncertainty, measured as the ratio of the width of the interval to the midpoint of the interval.
;; Engineers usually specify percentage tolerances on the parameters of devices, as in the resistor specifications
;; given earlier. Define a constructor make-center-percent that takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces
;; the desired interval. You must also define a selector percent that produces the percentage tolerance for a given

;; Exercise 2.20: The procedures +, *, and list take arbitrary numbers of arguments. One way to define such procedures
;; is to use define with dotted-tail notation. In a procedure definition, a parameter list that has a dot before the
;; last parameter indicates that, when the procedure is called, the initial parameters (if any) will have as values the
;; initial arguments, as usual, but the final parameter's value will be a list of any remaining arguments. For example,
;; given the definition
;; (define (f x y . z) <body>)
;; the procedure f can be called with two or more arguments. If we evaluate
;; (f 1 2 3 4 5 6)
;; then in the body of f, x will be 1, y will be 2, and z will be the list (3 4 5 6). Use this notation to write a
;; procedure same-parity that takes one or more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have the same
;; even-odd parity as the first argument. For example,
;; (same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
;; (1 3 5 7)
;; (same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
;; (2 4 6)

;; Exercise 2.34: Evaluating a polynomial in x at a given value of x can be formulated as an accumulation. We evaluate
;; the polynomial
;; a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0
;; using a well-known algorithm called Horner's rule, which structures the computation as
;; (... (a_n x + a_{n-1}) x + ... + a_1) x + a_0
;; In other words, we start with a_n, multiply by x, add a_{n-1}, multiply by x, and so on, until we reach a_0. Fill in
;; the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates a polynomial using Horner's rule. Assume that the
;; coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence, from a_0 through a_n.

(defn horner-eval [x coefficient-sequence]
  (reduce (fn [acc a] (+ acc (* x a))) 0 coefficient-sequence))

;; Exercise 2.35: Redefine count-leaves from section 2.2.2 as an accumulation:
(defn count-leaves [x]
  (accumulate (fn [a b] (+ a b)) 0 (map (fn [y] (if (list? y) (count-leaves y) 1)) x)))

;; Exercise 2.36: The procedure accumulate-n is similar to accumulate, except that it takes as its third argument a
;; sequence of sequences, which are all assumed to have the same number of elements. It applies the designated
;; accumulation procedure to combine all the first elements of the sequences, all the second elements of the sequences,
;; and so on, and returns a sequence of the results. For instance, if s is a sequence containing four sequences,
;; ((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12)), then the value of (accumulate-n + 0 s) should be (22 26 30). Fill in the
;; missing expressions in the following definition of accumulate-n:
(defn accumulate-n [op init seqs]
  (if (empty? (first seqs))
    '()
    (clojure.core/cons (accumulate op init (map first seqs))
                       (accumulate-n op init (map rest seqs)))))

;; Exercise 2.37: Suppose we represent vectors v = (v_1 v_2 ... v_n) as sequences of numbers, and matrices m as sequences
;; of vectors (the rows of the matrix). For example, the matrix
;; 1 2 3 4
;; 4 5 6 6
;; 6 7 8 9
;; would be represented as ((1 2 3 4) (4 5 6 6) (6 7 8 9)). With this representation, we can use sequence operations
;; to concisely express the basic matrix and vector operations. These operations (which are described in any book on
;; matrix algebra) are the following:
;; - Vector dot product: (dot-product v w) = v_1 w_1 + ... + v_n w_n
;; - Matrix multiplication: (matrix-*-vector m v) = (v_1 dot-product row_1) ... (v_n dot-product row_n)
;; - Matrix multiplication: (matrix-*-matrix m n) = ((row_1-*-column_1) ... (row_1-*-column_n)) ... ((row_n-*-column_1) ... (row_n-*-column_n))
;; - Transpose: (transpose m) = ((m_1 1 ... m_n 1) ... (m_1 n ... m_n n))
;; We can define the dot product as
(defn dot-product [v w]
  (accumulate + 0 (map * v w)))
;; Fill in the missing expressions in the following procedures for computing the other matrix operations:
(defn matrix-*-vector [m v]
  (map #(dot-product % v) m))

(defn transpose [m]
  (accumulate-n clojure.core/cons '() m))

(defn matrix-*-matrix [m n]

    (map #(matrix-*-vector cols %) m)))

;; Exercise 2.38: The accumulate procedure is also known as fold-right, because it combines the first element of the
;; sequence with the result of combining all the elements to the right. There is also a fold-left, which is similar to
;; fold-right, except that it combines elements working in the opposite direction:
(defn fold-left [op initial sequence]
  (letfn [(iter [result s]
            (if (empty? s)
              result
              (recur (op result (first s)) (rest s))))]
    (iter initial sequence)))

;; (fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
;; (fold-right list '() (list 1 2 3))
;; (fold-left list '() (list 1 2 3))
;; Give a property that op should satisfy to guarantee that fold-right and fold-left will produce the same values for any

;; Exercise 2.42: The "eight-queens puzzle" asks how to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no queen is in check
;; from any other (i.e., no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal). One possible solution is shown in
;; figure 2.6. One way to solve the puzzle is to work across the board, placing a queen in each column. Once we have
;; placed k - 1 queens, we must place the kth queen in a position where it does not check any of the queens already
;; on the board. We can formulate this approach recursively: Suppose that we have already generated the sequence of all
;; possible ways to place k - 1 queens in the first k - 1 columns of the board. For each of these ways, we generate an
;; extended set of positions by placing a queen in each row of the kth column. Now we filter these, keeping only the
;; positions for which the queen in the kth column is safe with respect to the other queens. This produces the sequence
;; of all ways to place k queens in the first k columns. By continuing this process, we will produce not only one
;; solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.
;; We implement this solution as a procedure queens that returns a sequence of all solutions to the problem of placing
;; n queens on an n x n chessboard. Queens has an internal procedure queen-cols that returns the sequence of all
;; positions to place a queen in the first k columns of the board.

;; Exercise 2.43: Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 2.42. His queens procedure seems to work, but

;(flatmap
;  (lambda (new-row)
;    (map
;      (lambda (rest-of-queens)
;        (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))

;; Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve
;; the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time T.

;; This interchange makes the program run slowly because the number of ways to place k queens in the first k columns is
;; much larger than the number of ways to place k - 1 queens in the first k - 1 columns. The program will take T times
;; 8 times T to solve the eight-queens puzzle.
